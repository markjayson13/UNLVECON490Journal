  We analyze how post-pandemic airline capacity influenced the pace of tourism recovery in Las Vegas. Using monthly BTS T-100 data merged with STR hotel performance metrics, we estimate elasticities between available seat miles and hotel occupancy. The findings suggest capacity additions from low-cost carriers accelerated recovery in weekend leisure segments but had muted effects on weekday business travel.
